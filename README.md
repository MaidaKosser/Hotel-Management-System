# 🏨 Hotel Management System

A console-based **Hotel Management System** developed using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Java. This project handles basic hotel operations such as guest management, room bookings, check-ins, and check-outs—perfect for understanding real-life application of OOP principles.

## 🎯 Objective

To simulate the core functionalities of a hotel in a structured and modular way using key OOP concepts like:

- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction

---

## 💡 Features

- ✅ Add, View, and Remove Customer Details  
- 🛏️ Room Booking and Availability Tracking  
- 📆 Check-In and Check-Out System  
- 🧾 Generate Receipts or Booking Summary  
- 🔐 Basic Authentication System (if implemented)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java (OOP based)**
- Console I/O
- UML Diagrams
- Class and Object-based structure
